# SymClone

## :newspaper: About the project

SymClone is a powerful Python library designed to provide advanced symbolic mathematics capabilities similar to the renowned SymPy library. With SymClone, users can manipulate symbolic expressions, perform calculus operations, pretty print expressions in various formats, and more.

### How it was done

Identify the core functionalities of SymPy that need to be replicated.
Understand the design principles and architecture of SymPy.

__Design Phase:__
Determine the overall architecture of the new library.
Decide on the programming language(s) to be used.
Design the data structures and algorithms necessary for symbolic mathematics operations.

__Implementation:__
Begin by implementing the foundational components, such as expressions, symbols, and basic arithmetic operations.
Gradually extend the functionality to include more advanced features like calculus, algebra, and differential equations.
Ensure compatibility with existing SymPy functionality, including support for symbolic manipulation, simplification, and equation solving.

__Testing:__
Develop a comprehensive test suite to verify the correctness and robustness of the implemented functionality.
Conduct rigorous testing to compare the results of the new library with SymPy to ensure consistency.

__Documentation:__
Provide thorough documentation for users, including tutorials, examples, and API references.
Ensure clarity and accessibility to facilitate adoption by the mathematical and scientific community.

__Optimization:__
Optimize performance where possible, especially for frequently used operations.
Consider parallelization and optimization techniques to enhance computational efficiency.

__Community Engagement:__
Foster a community around the new library by encouraging contributions, feedback, and collaboration.
Establish communication channels such as forums, mailing lists, and version control repositories.

__Integration and Compatibility:__
Ensure seamless integration with existing Python libraries and frameworks commonly used in scientific computing.
Provide compatibility with relevant standards and formats to facilitate interoperability with other software tools.

__Maintenance and Support:__
Commit to ongoing maintenance and support to address bugs, add new features, and keep the library up-to-date with the latest developments in symbolic mathematics.

__Promotion and Adoption:__
Promote the new library through academic publications, conference presentations, and collaborations with research institutions.
Encourage adoption by educators, researchers, and practitioners in various fields of science, engineering, and mathematics.
By following these steps meticulously and leveraging the expertise of the MIT community, we can create a clone of SymPy that not only replicates its functionality but also advances the state-of-the-art in symbolic mathematics.
